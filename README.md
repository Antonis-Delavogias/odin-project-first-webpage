Good evening, first of all I am very excited to have the honor of doing my first project. The purpose of the project is to create a website where we will post our 3 favorite recipes.
Its purpose is that each recipe has a picture of the food, a short description, what we need to cook and the steps one by one numbered in order.
 
I won't say I forced myself because it didn't work out, I enjoyed it a lot. 
After today's work, I feel more familiar with git and its commands, and certainly much more familiar with writing manually in html!

I look forward to the next projects!
