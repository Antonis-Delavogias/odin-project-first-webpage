    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p><em>These little goodies are the perfect addition to your next holiday gathering or even the perfect appetizer to serve<br>
            before a cozy dinner at home. Everyone will be dazzled by every delicious bite (they won't be able to keep their hands off of them!)<br> 
            You can smile while you think of how easy they were to toss together! And the best part - I usually end up with leftover stuffing<br>
             which freezes beautifully until the next carry-in!</em></p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced green onion</li>
        <li>1 cup cooked crabmeat, finely chopped</li>
        <li>½ cup dry bread crumbs</li>
        <li>¼ cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried dill weed</li>
        <li>½ cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds fresh button mushrooms, stems removed</li>
        <li>½ cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
        <li>¼ cup dry white wine</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Using a paring knife, cut each date lengthwise through to the middle. Combine goat cheese and rosemary 
            in a bowl<br>until evenly mixed. Stuff each date with the goat cheese mixture. Wrap each date with a small piece
            of bacon and secure<br>with a toothpick. Place on prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. </Li>
        <li>Turn on the broiler and place baking sheet 6 inches from heat. Broil until bacon is browned and slightly crispy, 1 to 2 minutes.<br>
            Remove from oven and place on a serving platter; drizzle dates with hot honey.</li>
    </ol>
