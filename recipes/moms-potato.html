    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p><em>Latkes (potato pancakes) are a must-have at Hanukkah, but are really wonderful any time of the year!<br>
            This is my mother's recipe, which is honestly the best potato latke I've had.<br>
            I usually end up making a second batch because they disappear so quickly.<br>
            I've tried other recipes and always return to this one. Lovely topped with sour cream or applesauce.</em></p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups shredded potato</li>
        <li>¼ cup grated onion</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>6 saltine crackers, or as needed, crushed</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix potato, onion, eggs, crushed crackers, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat 1/4 inch oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Drop spoonfuls of the potato mixture, first pressing potato mixture against the side of the bowl<br>
            to remove excess liquid, into the hot oil; slightly flatten the latkes into the oil with the back<br>
            of your spoon so they are an even thickness.</Li>
        <li>Cook in batches in the hot oil until browned and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes per side.<br>
            Drain latkes on a paper towel-line plate.</li>
    </ol>
